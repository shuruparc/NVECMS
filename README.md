# NVECMS
This project was built during my last year of university as my final year project. 
The aim was to build a web application for editors/publishers to host their resources for teachers to use, supported by a SQL relational database.
Upon downloading the project, you must first upload a local SQL database and then, access the site on your local database local://NVECMS. This will take you to the home page where you will be able to register and then login to use the system.
